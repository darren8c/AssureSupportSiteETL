This is a readme for the different resource files in this directory, what they do and what their format is:

categoryMapping.txt:
	This file maps discourse category ids to the new q2a category name, "Delete" is a special category.
	Anything in "Delete" will not be brought to a category but instead won't be transferred at all
	Format:
		discourse_category_id, new_category_name

roleMapping.txt:
	This file maps discourse id's of users who were admin/mods on discourse and maps them to a new role on q2a, if an id is not listed
	they are just mapped to a default user "Registered level" which is level=0.
	Format:
		discourse_id, new_role_name

specialUserPosts.txt:
	This file is an override to certain users so specific users posts will be either modified, hidden or otherwise be treated differently,
	i.e. there are many guides on discourse which are outdated and don't need to be transferred over these posts are all made by the same user so they are 
	given the flag "Nathan".
	Flag types:
		"delete Q" (don't transfer any questions made by this user)
		"delete P" (don't transfer any questions, answers, made by this user)
		"obscure" (don't transfer any questions made by this user, unless their are answers/comments made by different users)
		"Nathan" (congrats to Nathan for his own flag, remove any posts made on Apr 4 or begin with "FB " in the title)

	Format:
		discourse_id, flag_type

BadTags.txt:
	This file is list of tags that can't be allowed, tags are automatically created but a couple tags (i.e. him) don't make sense.

	Format:
		tagword
